Google homepage

This is a lesson in the odin project. I'm seeking to recreate the looks of the google homepage. 
Not necessarily to make it exact, just simply similar. 
It doesn't need to be functional, either, not the goal of this. 

I don't know if I'll come back and finish it, but it's a fun project. 

I enjoy projects like this where I can see how fast I can get to a final product. 

Let me know if you'd change anything. 

Needed to heavily borrow some code for the etch a sketch program but heavily read through it to make sure i understood everything. Was having trouble getting event listeners to focus on one div and not many, also had trouble trying to get flexbot to work and used grid which I'm less familiar with.
